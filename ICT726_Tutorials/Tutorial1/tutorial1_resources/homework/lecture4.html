        <h2>Static Sites</h2>

        <p>
          Static Sites: A static website consists of fixed content that does not
          change or require server-side processing each time a user accesses it.
          The web pages are delivered to the user's browser exactly as stored,
          often comprising HTML, CSS, and images. Static sites are typically
          easier and faster to develop since they don't rely on databases or
          complex programming languages; each page is a separate file. They are
          ideal for simple websites, such as portfolios, landing pages, or
          informational sites, where the content remains consistent over time.
          Static sites generally load quickly and are more secure due to their
          lack of server-side processing, but they require manual updates to
          change content, which can be time-consuming for larger sites.

        <h2>Dynamic Sites</h2>

        <p>
          Dynamic Sites: In contrast, dynamic websites generate content
          on-the-fly based on user interactions or other variables. These sites
          utilize server-side programming languages (like PHP, Python, or Ruby)
          and databases to create personalized content tailored to individual
          users. For instance, when a user logs into a dynamic site, the server
          retrieves data from a database and displays it based on user
          preferences or input. This makes dynamic sites suitable for
          applications requiring frequent updates and user engagement, such as
          social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and content management
          systems. Dynamic websites can provide a more interactive and
          personalized experience but may require more complex development and
          maintenance efforts compared to static sites.

        <h2>Differences</h2>

        <p>
          Differences: The primary difference between static and dynamic sites
          lies in how content is delivered and updated. Static sites serve
          pre-defined content that remains unchanged until manually updated,
          making them fast and straightforward but less flexible for user
          interaction. Dynamic sites, on the other hand, generate content in
          real time based on user input and server-side processes, allowing for
          a more personalized experience but often at the cost of increased
          complexity and slower load times. Additionally, static sites are
          typically easier to host and more secure due to their lack of
          server-side scripts, while dynamic sites require robust hosting
          solutions to handle database interactions and user requests.
