        <h2>Overview of Core Web Technologies</h2>

        <p>
            The web is powered by a variety of technologies that work together 
            to deliver interactive and engaging content to users. 
            Key components include HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for 
            structuring content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, 
            and JavaScript for adding interactivity. HTML provides the foundational 
            elements for a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. 
            CSS allows developers to control the visual presentation of these elements, 
            such as color schemes, spacing, and responsive layouts. JavaScript, a programming language, enables dynamic actions like animations, form validation, and content updates, enhancing the overall user experience.

        <h2>HTTP and HTTPS Protocols</h2>

        <p>
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are the primary protocols used to transfer data over the web. HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and enables the client-server communication model, allowing browsers (clients) to request data from web servers. HTTPS adds a layer of security by encrypting data through SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption helps protect sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card details, ensuring privacy and integrity of data as it travels between the client and server.

        <h2>Introduction to DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>

        <p>DNS (Domain Name System) acts as the Internet's phonebook by translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. When a user types a web address into their browser, the DNS server locates the associated IP address, allowing the browser to establish a connection with the websiteâ€™s server. DNS streamlines web navigation by letting users access sites using memorable names instead of complex IP addresses.</p>
