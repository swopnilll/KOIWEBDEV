        <h2>The course overview</h2>

        <p>
          The learning objectives for this course encompass developing and
          demonstrating practical skills in foundational web development and
          ensuring best practices in usability, accessibility, security, and
          data management. Students will learn to create web pages using HTML,
          CSS, and media elements, incorporating forms with robust error
          handling and validation for a seamless user experience. They will also
          gain experience in building dynamic, data-driven websites that comply
          with accessibility standards and ethical guidelines, prioritizing
          privacy and usability for diverse audiences. Moreover, students will
          implement server-side authentication and access control measures to
          enhance web application security, ensuring that sensitive data is
          protected. Finally, students will critically evaluate content
          management systems (CMS) for their effectiveness and suitability in
          supporting scalable, accessible, and search-engine-optimized websites.

        <h2>Introduction to the Internet</h2>

        <p>
          The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that
          enables users to share information and communicate across vast
          distances. It operates through a series of protocols, with TCP/IP
          (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) being the primary
          framework that defines how data is transmitted between devices. The
          Internet has transformed the way we access information, conduct
          business, and interact with each other by allowing for instant access
          to websites, email, social media, and other online services. This
          interconnected network is made possible by ISPs (Internet Service
          Providers), routers, and various data centers worldwide, creating a
          complex but efficient system for data exchange.

        <h3>Differences between Client-Server Models and HTML Tags</h3>

        <p>
          The client-server model and HTML tags are fundamental to web
          interactions but serve distinct roles. The client-server model is an
          architecture that divides r esponsibilities between two entities: the
          client (typically a user’s device) and the server (which hosts data or
          services). The client sends requests, and the server processes these
          requests and sends back the required data. This model underpins most
          internet services, such as web browsing, where a browser (client)
          requests a webpage, and the server responds with the necessary files.
          HTML tags, on the other hand, are elements within web pages that
          define structure and content. Tags like h1, p, and img tell the
          browser how to display text, images, links, and other content types,
          ensuring a consistent and readable page layout for users. While the
          client-server model manages data exchange, HTML tags determine the
          content’s presentation within that exchange.
